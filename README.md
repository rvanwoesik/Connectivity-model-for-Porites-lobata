# Connectivity-model-for-Porites-lobata
R code for Porites lobata: 10.1111/jbi.13115

We aim to determine the effects of genetic isolation and local adaptation in species-distribution modelling of
the ubiquitous species P. lobata under three climate change scenarios by comparing
contiguous and isolated subpopulations.
